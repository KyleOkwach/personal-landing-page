          I'm Kyle Bolo, a curious builder at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and data systems.
          I thrive on crafting clean code, designing smart models, and making pipelines that somehow just work.
          Outside of code, Iâ€™m either strumming my guitar, sketching ideas, or diving into some obscure tech mystery.
          I believe in the power of creation, tools, ideas, and stories, and Iâ€™m always up for solving meaningful problems with passionate people.
          Let's create something awesome!
